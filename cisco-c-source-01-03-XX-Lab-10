//  Lab 1.3.6.5 Variables: part 5
//  Objectives
//    Fixing errors in a program
//    Variable names
//    Integer numbers
//    Printing on screen
//  Scenario
//    Write a program which computes and prints the sum of the days in all 
//    four quarters of the current year. Use variables to store these four
//    values.
//  
//    If you want, you can use code from a previous task, but you will learn 
//    more if you write the code from the beginning.

// Write your code here.  You need to include any libraries, add your "main()" routine, 
//  and all the other stuff a program needs.  Check out your old programs.

//  Example output
//    Days in Q1 of the current year: 91
//    Days in Q2 of the current year: 91
//    Days in Q3 of the current year: 92
//    Days in Q4 of the current year: 92
//  Example output
//    Days in Q1 of the current year: 90
//    Days in Q2 of the current year: 91
//    Days in Q3 of the current year: 92
//    Days in Q4 of the current year: 92
