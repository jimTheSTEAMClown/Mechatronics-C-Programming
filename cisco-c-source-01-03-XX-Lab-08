//  Lab 1.3.6.3 Variables: part 3
//  Objectives
//    Familiarize the student with:
//    Fixing errors in a program
//      Variable names
//      Integer numbers
//      Printing on screen
//  Scenario
//    Check the program below. Find all possible compilation errors and 
//    logic errors. Fix them. Your version of the program must print the
//    same result as the expected output. Before you use your compiler, 
//    try to find the errors only by manual code analysis. If you want to 
//    improve the variable names, then do so, but remember that variable 
//    names have to be as descriptive as possible, and also as short as possible.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int ip Part1 = 027;
  int ip Part2 = 0;
  int ip Part3 = 0;
  int ip Part4 = 1;
  printf("Localhost IP is %d.%d.%d.%d\n", ip Part1, ip Part2, ip Part3, ip Part4);
}

//  Example output
//    Localhost IP is 127.0.0.1
