//  Lab 1.3.6.1 Variables: part 1
//  Objectives
//    Familiarize the student with:
//    Fixing errors in a program
//    Variable names
//    Integer numbers
//    Printing on screen
//  Scenario
//    Check the program below. Find all possible compilation errors and 
//    logic errors. Fix them. Your version of the program must print the
//    same result as the expected output. Before you use your compiler, 
//    try to find the errors only by manual code analysis. If you want to 
//    improve the variable names, then do so, but remember that variable names 
//    have to be as descriptive as possible, and also as short as possible.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int simpleVari able = 10;
printf("The value of ten is: %d \n", otherVariable);
return 0;
}

//  Example output
//    The value of ten is: 10
