//  Lab 1.3.6.4 Variables: part 4
//  Objectives
//    Familiarize the student with:
//    Fixing errors in program
//    Variable names
//    Integer numbers
//    Printing on screen
//  Scenario
//    Check the program below. Find all possible compilation errors 
//    and logic errors. Fix them. Your version of the program must print the
//    same result as the expected output. Before you use your compiler, 
//    try to find the errors only by manual code analysis. Remember to find
//    the logic errors (check the order of the months). If you want to improve 
//    the variable names, then do so, but remember that variable names 
//    have to be as descriptive as possible, and also as short as possible.

//  Example output
//    Days in the first half of the current year: 182
//    Days in the second half of the current year: 184
