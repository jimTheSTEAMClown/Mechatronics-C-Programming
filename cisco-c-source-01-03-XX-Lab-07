//  Lab 1.3.6.2 Variables: part 2
//  Objectives
//    Familiarize the student with:
//    Fixing errors in a program
//    Variable names
//    Integer numbers
//    Printing on screen
//  Scenario
//    Check the program below. Find all possible compilation errors and 
//    logic errors. Fix them. Your version of the program must print the
//    same result as the expected output. Before you use your compiler, 
//    try to find the errors only by manual code analysis. If you want to 
//    improve the variable names, then do so, but remember that variable 
//    names have to be as descriptive as possible, and also as short as possible.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int 60seconds = 60;
int 60minutes = 50;
printf("One hour is %d seconds\n", 60seconds * 60minutes);
return 0;
}

//  Example output
//    One hour is 3600 seconds
